# Gnomes vs Ghosts

This is a game made for [the first Unwrap game jam](https://itch.io/jam/unwrap-jam-2023). You can find the submission page [here](https://maloudepaepe.itch.io/gnome-vs-ghosts).
For many of us, this was the first time working in a team and participating in a game jam. We learned a lot about git, planning our work and scope.
Even though the end product is not something that shows our capacities, it was a great and very fun learning experience.
